Today, millions believe there is life in outer space. Millions are enthusiastic about "UFO'S," about "close encounters" with beings from other planets. Dozens of books festoon bookshelves in major bookstores dealing with such alleged sightings and experiences.
The American taxpayer is assessed BILLIONS of dollars to finance NASA probes of Mars and other planets as evolutionists seek to determine whether LIFE may exist, or may have once existed, on the Red Planet. Scientists, driven by the evolutionary mind-set, speculate about whether life began on Mars, rather than earth. They utterly reject the Biblical account of creation, continually speaking and writing about "evolution," which seeks to explain creation without a Creator; life without a Life-giver; design without a Designer; laws without a Lawgiverâ€”an empty theory which utterly denies the existence of God.
Few know they possess a book which details a visit to this earth by a great, superhuman Being from outer space. Few know that an intergalactic Traveler, who lives in a completely DIFFERENT DIMENSION from our three-dimensional, physical world, visited this earth on many occasions; that He left His dimension of spirit, became human, and walked among us. His name, in the English language, is "Jesus Christ." Hundreds of millions have heard His name. Yet, those same people know little about Him, and even less about the MESSAGE He brought from His Father. That message He called "The GOOD NEWS." In contrast to the news we hear nearly every day, it is the BEST news we could EVER HEAR!
